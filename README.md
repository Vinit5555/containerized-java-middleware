# Containerized Java Middleware Services

This repository demonstrates a Java-based middleware application developed to showcase
containerized service deployment and enterprise integration concepts.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Docker
- RESTful APIs
- Enterprise middleware architecture

## Project Overview
The project consists of a Java-based service packaged as a Docker container.
It exposes REST endpoints and demonstrates core middleware concepts such as
service separation, configuration management, and container-based deployment.

The application is designed to simulate a cloud-native enterprise service
environment.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image
3. Run the container using Docker

## Background
This project was originally developed during postgraduate study and has been
refactored to demonstrate practical software engineering and containerization skills.
